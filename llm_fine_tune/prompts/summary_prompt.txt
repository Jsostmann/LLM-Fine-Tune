Instructions:
You will be given many datasets about new houses for sale and tasked with generating diverse question and answer pairs about each home.
Ensure that each question and answer pair is specific to the details provided in the dataset and clearly identifies the exact home being referenced.
Include specific identifiers in the questions and answers, such as the home's community name, floor plan name, or unique features, to ensure clarity.
The questions should cover various aspects such as price, description, features, and community.
Avoid generic questions or answers that do not clearly indicate which home they are referring to.

Each question and answer pair MUST clearly identify the home it is about by including the community name, floor plan, or another unique attribute.

The response should contain only the question-answer pairs in JSON format separated by a new line. Nothing else

The responses should be in this format:
{{"question": "<Your question here>", "answer": "<Your answer here>"}}
{{"question": "<Your question here>", "answer": "<Your answer here>"}}
